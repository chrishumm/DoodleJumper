# DoodleJumper

This is Doodle Jumper! (Creative name, right?). It is a Doodle Jump clone written for Android and iOS. The game is written in C++ and uses the cocos2dx library, which can be used to port to other platforms.The aim of the game is to keep going higher. You need to use your mobiles accelerometer to control the character. Position yourself to land on the platforms and be careful! Some platforms will break and you need to time your jumps correctly.

It is currently in an alpha state and is actively being developed as you read this! If you want to help or contribute, see [below](#support)

# Features

- High-score tracking
- Infinite Levels
- Accelerometer based controls (Android Only)

# TODO

As an alpha game, the following features are being worked on and implemented:
- Different platform types


# Getting Started

You can download the installer in the release section to play it on Windows (Arrow key controls). You can also download the Android APK file to play it on your mobile device.

## Installing from source (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have all the below installed:

- A C++ compiler (Either Visual Studio or Code::Blocks for Windows)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)
- Cocos2dx 2.1.5 library 

If using Visual Studio, you must first compile cocos2dx and add the project under the 'projects' folder. It currently works on 2.x versions of cocos2dx, but 2.1.5 is the most stable.
